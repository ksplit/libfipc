 *
 * Fast, asynchronous IPC library using shared
 * memory.
 *
 * The main object here is a duplex, ring channel, used by two
 * threads, or processes, etc., shown below:
 *
 *                   |                                  |
 *                   |          Shared Memory           |
 *      Thread 1     |                                  |     Thread 2
 *      --------     |                                  |     --------
 *                   |                                  |
 *  header           |                                  |      header
 *  +----+           |    +--------------------------+  |      +-----+
 *  | rx ---------------->|      memory buffer 1     |  |      |     |
 *  |    |           | +---------------------------+ |<--------- tx  |
 *  | tx ------------->|       memory buffer 2     |-+  |      |     |
 *  |    |           | |                           |<----------- rx  |
 *  +----+           | +---------------------------+    |      +-----+
 *                   |                                  |
 *                   |                                  |
 *
 * There are a couple things to note here.
 *
 *    1 - The ring channel consists of two buffers in shared memory, and
 *        two distinct headers on each side. These headers *need not be* in
 *        a region of memory shared by the two threads.
 *
 *    2 - Memory buffer 1 is used by Thread 2 to send messages to Thread 1
 *        (Thread 2's tx points to memory buffer 1, and Thread 1's rx points
 *        to memory buffer 1.) Similarly, for memory buffer 2. So, data
 *        can flow both directions.
 *
 * Each header is a header_t. header_t
 * consists of two struct fipc_ring_buf's -- one for each direction (tx/rx).
 *
 * The memory buffers are treated as circular buffers, whose slots are
 * message_t's.
 *
 *                           memory buffer layout
 *    +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---- ...
 *    | struct       | struct       | struct       | struct       |
 *    | fipc_message | fipc_message | fipc_message | fipc_message |
 *    +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---- ...
 *
 * Ring Channel Initialization
 * ---------------------------
 *
 * There are few steps:
 *
 *         1 - Allocate and initialize the shared memory buffers
 *
 *         2 - Allocate the headers (header_t's). These
 *             can be statically allocated (e.g. global variables).
 *
 *         3 - Initialize the headers
 *
 * In a typical scenario, Thread 1 will allocate both memory buffers and
 * share them with Thread 2 (how this is done depends on the environment).
 * Thread 1 and Thread 2 will allocate their private headers, and initialize
 * them to point to the allocated memory buffers. Here is how this looks
 * for Thread 1 using the libfipc interface (return values ignored):
 *
 *     --------
 *     Thread 1
 *     --------
 *
 *     header_t t1_chnl_header;
 *
 *     // Allocate shared memory buffers
 *     unsigned int buf_order = .. buffers are 2^buf_order bytes ..
 *     char *buffer_1 = ... alloc memory buffer 1 ...
 *     char *buffer_2 = ... alloc memory buffer 1 ...
 *
 *     // Initialize the shared buffers (*required*)
 *     fipc_prep_buffers(buf_order, buffer_1, buffer_2);
 *
 *     .... share buffers with Thread 2 ...
 *
 *     // Initialize my header_t header
 *     fipc_ring_channel_init(&t1_chnl_header, buf_order,
 *                            buffer_1,
 *                            buffer_2);
 *
 * Send/Receive
 * ------------
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If you plan to share the same tx or rx header on one
 * side of the channel amongst multiple threads, fipc_send_msg_start and
 * fipc_recv_msg_start/if are NOT thread safe. (Some libfipc users may
 * not require it, so we don't do any synchronization internally.) So,
 * you should wrap calls to these functions in locks as necessary. See
 * their documentation for more comments.
 *
 * (Of course, communication across the channel itself to the other side
 * does not require explicit synchronization of threads on opposite sides.)
 *
 * A typical send/receive sequence is as follows, assuming the headers
 * have been initialized already:
 *
 *     --------
 *     Thread 1
 *     --------
 *
 *     message_t *msg;
 *     int ret;
 *
 *     do {
 *
 *        // Allocate a slot to put message in
 *        ret = fipc_send_msg_start(t1_chnl_header, &msg);
 *
 *     } while (ret == -EWOULDBLOCK);
 *
 *     msg->regs[0] = 1;
 *     msg->regs[1] = 2;
 *     ...
 *
 *     // Mark message as sent (receiver will see status change)
 *     fipc_send_msg_end(t1_chnl_header, msg);
 *
 *     --------
 *     Thread 2
 *     --------
 *
 *     message_t *msg;
 *     int ret;
 *
 *     do {
 *
 *        // Wait for message to receive
 *        ret = fipc_recv_msg_start(t2_chnl_header, &msg);
 *
 *     } while (ret == -EWOULDBLOCK);
 *
 *     ... do something with msg ...
 *
 *     // Mark message as received (sender will see slot as available)
 *     fipc_recv_msg_end(t2_chnl_header, msg);
 *
 * Ring Channel Tear down
 * ----------------------
 *
 * When you're done using the ring channel (you should probably wait until
 * both threads are done -- using some other mechanism), there is no tear
 * down required. (You are the one responsible for allocating the headers
 * and shared memory buffers, so you need to tear them down.)

/**

 *
 * Messages are received in increasing slot order (wrapping around when
 * we reach the end of the memory buffer). Internally, we maintain a
 * cursor to the next slot where we expect a message, and wait until the
 * sender puts one there. When the sender puts a message there, and a
 * thread on the receiving side receives the message (by invoking this
 * function), we increment the cursor by 1.
 *
 * XXX: This implies that if the sender screws up and doesn't send messages
 * in increasing slot order, the receiver will be stuck waiting. (This
 * can happen if a thread on the sending side allocates a slot to send
 * a message in, but doesn't mark the message as ready to be
 * received -- i.e., failing to call fipc_send_msg_end.)
 *
 * If there are no messages to be received, returns -EWOULDBLOCK. (More
 * precisely, if the current slot under the cursor does not contain a
 * ready message, returns -EWOULDBLOCK.)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If the caller fails to invoke fipc_recv_msg_end, the sender
 * will potentially block waiting for the slot to become free. So, make sure
 * your code cannot fail between start/end.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This function is NOT thread safe. To make this code fast,
